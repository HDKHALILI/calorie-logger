# This is a calorie logger app
The app uses nutritionix api to get data

### I have built this app as a part of code challenge for React job.

To run the application localy:
```
clone this repo
cd into the app
npm install
```

You need to sign up for a free account on nutritionix and get app id and key.
once you have the id and key create a .env (dotenv) file and save them in the file as follows:
```
REACT_APP_ID = your application id
REACT_APP_KEY = application key
```
